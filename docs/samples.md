## Multi-Feature Sample App

This sample demonstrates the following features:

* Nested reusable components
* Bottom navigation
* Nested navigation
* State preservation (using `StateKeeper`)
* Retaining instances (using `InstanceKeeper`)
* Pluggable UI (Android Views, Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, JS React)
* [Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery) for Android

Please note that Gradle files included in this sample project are not supposed to be used as a reference. They share the configuration with the reset of the library, which simplifies the maintenance a lot. Please refer to the [KMP documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.html) for information on configuring a KMP project. You can also check other sample projects described below.

Content:

* [shared](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared) - this is a shared module that contains the following components:
    * [Root](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/root) - the root (top-most) component, it displays the bottom navigation bar and the currently selected tab.
    * [Counters](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/counters) - the Counters tab, it has two `Child Stacks`, each with a stack of the `Counter` component.
        * [Counter](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/counters/counter) - the `Counter` component, it just increments the counter every 250 ms. It starts counting once created and stops when destroyed. So `Counter` continues counting while in the back stack, unless recreated. It uses the `InstanceKeeper`, so counting continues after Android configuration changes. The `StateKeeper` is used to preserve the state when the process is recreated on Android.
    * [MultiPane](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/multipane) - the Multi-Pane tab, it displays `List` and `Details` components either in a stack (one on top of another) or side by side. **Please note that this sample is for advanced single-pane/multi-pane navigation and layout, for generic master-detail navigation please refer to the Sample Todo List App described below.**
        * [ArticleList](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/multipane/list) - displays a random list of articles. Clicking on an item triggers the `ArticleDetails` component.
        * [ArticleDetails](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/multipane/details) - displays the content of the selected article.
    * [DynamicFeatures](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/dynamicfeatures) - the Dynamic Features tab, it demonstrates the usage of [Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery) on Android, while using classing integration on other platforms. There are two simple feature components - `Feature1` and `Feature2` - they are located in separate modules described below.
        * [DynamicFeature](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/arkivanov/sample/shared/dynamicfeatures/dynamicfeature) - a helper component responsible for loading dynamic feature components.
* [compose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/compose) - this module contains Jetpack Compose UI.
* [dynamic-features/api](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/api) - this module contains only API for dynamic feature components.
* [dynamic-features/compose-api](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/feature1Impl) - this module contains only Jetpack Compose API for dynamic feature components.
* [dynamic-features/feature1Impl](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/feature1Impl) - contains the implementation of `Feature1` dynamic feature component. On Android it depends on `android-app` module and is used via reflection. On all other targets, the `shared` module directly depends on this module and no reflection is used.
* [dynamic-features/feature2Impl](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/shared/dynamic-features/feature2Impl) - contains the implementation of `Feature2` dynamic feature component. On Android it depends on `android-app` module and is used via reflection. On all other targets, the `shared` module directly depends on this module and no reflection is used.

* [Desktop sample app](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/app-desktop)

* [Web (JS) sample app](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose/tree/master/sample/app-js)
